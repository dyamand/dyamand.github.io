Interoperability between different technologies requires a common model to be used. DYAMAND uses a generic domain model that is flexible enough to model every technology.

The world according to DYAMAND is a collection of devices modeled by ```org.dyamand.model.Device```. These devices can contain any number of services (modeled by ```org.dyamand.model.service.Service```).

Each service in its turn consists of any number of states that represent the capabilities of the service. To model these states, the [objects defined by LwM2M](http://openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html) are used as a basis.

To see how this generic model can be extended for specific technologies or use cases, take a look at [the documentation on plugins](../plugins).
