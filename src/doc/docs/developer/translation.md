TODO test multiple translated states per translator + multiple translators with each 1 state

TODO keep on intercepting until translating that already was in the chain

## Translating state changes into new services

!!! failure "_4.1.0_ If a translator translates a state change into a new service, that service should be part of the same device as the original service, the original service should be set into the translated service and the translated service should be added to the original service, also a service online event should have been sent"
!!! failure "_4.1.1_ If a translator translates a state change into a new service and the original service goes offline, the translated service should also go offline (not being retrievable and service offline event)"
