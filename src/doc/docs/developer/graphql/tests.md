## Schema aggregation

!!! failure "_e.0.1_ For each conflicting GraphQL conflicting schema provider, the GraphQL aggregator should throw an IllegalStateException"
!!! success "_e.0.2_ For every GraphQL schema provider that comes online and goes offline again the schema of the GraphQL aggregator should be empty"

## Queries

!!! success "_e.1.1_ If N GraphQL schema providers come online, each with M queries that are different across all schemas, all queries should be available in the aggregated schema"

## Scalars

## Mutations

## Subscriptions

In order to support subscriptions in a scalable way, the communication with the clients and the actual subscriptions are split. The Subscriptions endpoint is responsible to setup an SSE connection with the clients interested in receiving event updates. The DYAMAND GraphQL endpoint can be used by clients to indicate which updates should be sent.

!!! failure "_e.5.0_ If there are no schema in the GraphQL aggregator, all subscriptions should be answered with an error"
!!! failure "_e.5.1_ If a GraphQL service with a random schema is online, every subscription adherent to that schema should succeed"
!!! failure "_e.5.2_ If a GraphQL service is online and has a client subscribed to, if the service sends an event, the event should reach the client"

### Subscriptions endpoint

!!! success "_e.6.0_ When N clients all request a subscription ID, N different subscription IDs should be returned"
!!! success "_e.6.1_ When a client sets up a subscription and closes the connection, the subscription ID should no longer be available and an event should have been sent on the *graphql.subscriptionRemoved* topic containing the subscription ID"
!!! success "_e.6.2_ When N clients setup a subscription and the subscription enpoint stops, no subscription IDs should be available and an event should have been sent on the *graphql.subscriptionRemoved* topic for all subscription IDs"
!!! failure "_e.6.3_ When a client sets up an SSE connection and a random message is sent on Redis on topic _subscriptionId_/_eventType_, an event should be sent on the SSE connection with event == eventType and data equal to the content of the message sent on Redis"
!!! failure "_e.6.4_ When a client sets up an SSE connection and a random message is sent on Redis on topic _otherSubscriptionId_/_eventType_, no event should be received over the SSE connection"

### GraphQL endpoint

!!! failure "_e.7.0_ When a client executes a subscription without a subscription ID, the subscription should fail with a 400 status code"
!!! failure "_e.7.1_ When a client executes a subscription with a subscriptionID and the subscription ID is not registered, the subscription should fail with a 400 status code"
!!! failure "_e.7.2_ When a client executes a subscription with a valid subscription ID and an event arrives, a message should be sent with topic _subscriptionId_/_operationName_ and the message should be equal to the output generated by the GraphQL subscription"

## Concurrency tests for the GraphQL endpoint

!!! failure "_e.9.1_ If n different valid queries arrive, they all should be answered without any errors"
!!! failure "_e.9.2_ If the same request arrive n times at the same time, they should all be answered without any errors"
